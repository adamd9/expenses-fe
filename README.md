# Expenses App (Frontend)

Expenses App (Frontend) is a basic static front-end for the Expenses App back-end. It deliberately uses no libraries and is written in pure JS. The app allows users to add one or more expenses to one of two expense accounts, then forecasts that show what the future account balance will be given the expenses and current balance.

## Installation

Just stick it on any static web server and point it at your Expenses App backend.
